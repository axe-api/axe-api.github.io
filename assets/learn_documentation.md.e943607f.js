It provides detailed explanations of API functionalities, endpoints, parameters, request/response formats, and authentication requirements.</p><p>Good API documentation enhances developer productivity, reduces learning curves, promotes proper API usage, and facilitates integration with other systems. Clear documentation also fosters collaboration and encourages the development of third-party applications, expanding the API&#39;s reach and potential.</p><p>Overall, API documentation is essential for seamless integration, developer satisfaction, and successful API adoption.</p><h2 id="best-practices" tabindex="-1">Best practices <a class="header-anchor" href="#best-practices" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Best practices&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Creating API documentation involves several best practices:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Clear Structure</strong>: Organize the documentation logically with sections such as introduction, endpoints, parameters, and examples. Use consistent formatting and headings.</p></li><li><p><strong>Request and Response Examples</strong>: Include sample requests and responses to illustrate how to interact with the API effectively. Cover different scenarios and provide code snippets in different ways.</p></li><li><p><strong>Detailed Parameter Documentation</strong>: Document all parameters, their types, required/optional status, and possible values. Explain their purpose with relevant examples.</p></li><li><p><strong>Error Handling</strong>: Provide a comprehensive list of error codes and their meanings. Describe how errors are returned and suggest error handling strategies for developers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Versioning</strong>: Clearly indicate the versioning scheme and how to specify the desired version in API requests.</p></li><li><p><strong>Regular Updates</strong>: Keep the documentation up to date with any changes or additions to the API. Communicate changes effectively, highlighting deprecated features and suggesting alternative approaches.</p></li></ul><p>Remember, high-quality API documentation is an ongoing process that requires regular maintenance and updates to ensure its relevance and usefulness to developers.</p><h2 id="auto-created-api-docs" tabindex="-1">Auto-created API docs <a class="header-anchor" href="#auto-created-api-docs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Auto-created API docs&quot;">​</a></h2><p>There are many best practices out there to be implemented as you can see. Creating well-designed API documentation requires a lot of time and energy. But <strong>we don&#39;t have that time and energy</strong>. That&#39;s why we&#39;ve built the Axe API framework.</p><p>Since Axe API already <strong><em>analyzes</em></strong> all of your models, routes, validations, etc, it is able to create your API documentation automatically in a common format. We call it <strong>auto-create documentation</strong>.</p><p>You can see the following link a full-working example of the documentation that has been created by Axe API automatically.</p><p><a href="https://bookstore.axe-api.com/docs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">bookstore.axe-api.com/docs</a></p><a href="https://bookstore.axe-api.com/docs" target="_blank" alt="Auto-created Axe API documentation"><img src="'+i+'"></a><p>As a developer, you can spend your valuable time developing API while Axe API is creating the documentation for you.</p><h2 id="supported-features" tabindex="-1">Supported features <a class="header-anchor" href="#supported-features" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Supported features&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The following features are supported by default;</p><ul><li>All of your model-based routes</li><li>All of your model-based/method-based validations</li><li>Default Axe API queries</li><li><code>cURL</code> request examples</li><li>HTTP response example</li><li>Multiple API versions</li><li>etc.</li></ul><h2 id="unsupported-features" tabindex="-1">Unsupported features <a class="header-anchor" href="#unsupported-features" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Unsupported features&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Since Axe API creates the documentation automatically by your model definitions, it is not able to create documentation for the custom developments you made. So the following list should be considered all the time;</p><ul><li>Custom routes</li><li>Custom validation rules in hooks</li><li>Custom logics in hooks/events</li><li>Middleware logics</li><li>Authentication/authorization structure</li><li>etc.</li></ul><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p><p>In the future, we are going to support markdown files to add your custom explanations to the documentation. Just keep following us.</p></div><h2 id="next-step" tabindex="-1">Next step <a class="header-anchor" href="#next-step" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Next step&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Axe API supports powerful documentation that is created automatically by your model definitions. It is another magic of Axe API.</p><p>But this is not enough.
