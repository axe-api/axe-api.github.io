If I create a model like that, will I not have to create controllers?&quot;</em></p><p>The answer is; <strong>&quot;No, you don&#39;t need to create controllers at all&quot;</strong>.</p><p>Axe API will handle your HTTP requests. Of course, there are many edge cases. For example, you may not want to create a DELETE route for your model. Also, you may add custom logic for a handler too such as sending confirmation e-mail after user creation. All of these requests are possible with different methods. We are going to talk about it in the next chapters.</p><h2 id="request-lifecycle" tabindex="-1">Request Lifecycle <a class="header-anchor" href="#request-lifecycle" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Although we are going to see many details about the HTTP request lifecycle, here we can explain some basic facts.</p><p>Whenever Axe API starts to handle an HTTP request, it does its own tasks. These are can be different by the handler type. But there is a constant flow for every handler and that flow would be followed by Axe API.</p><p>Also, Axe API checks the analyzed data. For example, in case you defined a Hooks or Events, Axe API is responsible to trigger your functions.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p><p><strong>Hooks</strong> and <strong>Events</strong> are very special concepts for the Axe API. Basically, if you want to send an e-mail after user creation, you need some kind of exit point. Because, the user creation process will be handled by Axe API. Hooks and Events are these exit points. Axe API lets you define special functions that can be used as Hooks or Events. So that you can add your special logic to the HTTP Request Lifecycle.</p></div><p>Like we said, for now, we don&#39;t need to go deeper.
