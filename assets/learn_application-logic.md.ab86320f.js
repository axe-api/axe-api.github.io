Nevertheless, almost every API might act differently in the new user creation process.</p><p>The reason behind it is that almost every API has a different <strong><em>application logic</em></strong>. For example, in an API might check the user&#39;s email address from external resources to validate if the user is a customer of the company&#39;s other database resources. Or, you can send a special welcoming email to the user if they have a special domain email.</p><p>These kinds of additions are designed by the <strong>domain</strong>. There can be very different scenarios for each API&#39;s design. All of the custom scenarios that can not be standardized by Axe API are called <strong>Application Logic</strong>.</p><h2 id="the-axe-api-approach" tabindex="-1">The Axe API approach <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-axe-api-approach" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The Axe API approach&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Axe API is just a framework that provides handling the <em>best-practices</em> by <em>model definitions</em>. It is <strong>NOT</strong> a <strong><em>no-code</em></strong> or <strong><em>low-code</em></strong> platform.</p><p>As a principle, the Axe API team doesn&#39;t believe that no-code platforms would for specialized applications. But also, we believe that we can provide a basic framework that handles the best-practices.</p><p>Axe API uses some connection points that are coded by yourself while it handles an HTTP request by model definition.
